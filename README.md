 ## 1. About the Study
<p>The study applies 3 ML/DL algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network) to do 7 class Land Use Land Cover classification for the area of Phnom Penh in Cambodia.
The classes are- 
0 'Tree',
1 'RoadsAndPavements',
2 'SavannahGrassland',
3 'Building',
4 'Water', 
5 'AgriculturalLand', 
6 'BareLand'
</p>
<p>The algorithms are applied in 2 different combinations of Sentinel 2B dataset. One with only Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8A, 9, 11 and 12 of Sentinel dataset. The another contains these bands along with 4 additional bands namely, Normalized Difference Builtup Index(NDBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index(NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index(NDWI), and Bare Soil Index(BSI).</p> 
<p>The objectives of this study includes understanding the impact of these indices on LULC classification, producing updated LULC maps. At the end, a new approach (hybrid) combining the outputs from the best models for each of the classes were proposed. This new approach shows the better accuracy then all other models attempted in the study.</p>

### 4.4 Impact of the indices on time complexity of the models
#### 4.4.1 SVM's accuracy reduces with the indices, but computation time decreases significantly

#### 4.4.2 RF and ANN gains accuracy when indices are added with data. But computation time increases

## 5. Conclusion
<p>The study finds that, indices has diferring effects on various ML/DL algorithms, specially for DL algorithms, it improves the OA significantly. On the otherhand, it drops the accuracy of SVM algorithm, however, yet in this case, it significantly improves the computation complexity. As of the best algorithm to classiy the LULC is concerned, SVM with only the Band 1-12 is the opmtimal one. However, the newly proposed approach based best class wise models overtrumps the accuracy of SVM .</p>
